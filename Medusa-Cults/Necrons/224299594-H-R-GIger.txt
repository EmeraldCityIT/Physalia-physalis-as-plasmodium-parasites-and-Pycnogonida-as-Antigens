“Within the world in which he moves, Giger occupies a unique place. His art is a category unto itself. The proof  of  this is in
  the intensity of  his creation and in the power of  his imagination, the provocative and disturbing efect of  which I can only
compare with the works of  a Hieronymus Bosch or Francis Bacon.”                Ridley Scott

               The Swiss painter and sculptor HR Giger
(*5  February  1940  in  Chur)  is  considered  one  of   the  most 
important  representatives  of   “Fantastic  Realism”.  “Bio-
mechanoids”,  a  term  associated  with  him,  are  a  recurring 
theme in his works; they emphasise the mechanical in living 
creatures.  This  along  with  the  attendant  sexual  connota-
tions often has a disturbing efect on the viewer. Giger has 
been  working  as  an  artist  since  the  mid  1960s.  His  works 
include  drawings,  oil  and 
airbrush  paintings,  sculptures, 
furniture,  designs  for  album 
covers  (including  for  Dead 
Kennedys,  Debbie  Harry,  and 
Danzig) and flms.
Giger’s  most  famous  work  for 
flm  is  the  monster  that  he 
created  for  the  classic  movie 
ALIEN (Ridley Scott, USA 1979). 
He received a “Best Achievement 
for  Visual  Efects”  Academy 
Award  (Oscar)  in  1980  for  his 
creation of  the movie´s title
character and for the extraterres-
trial  design.  Designs  for  other 
flms  such  as  POLTERGEIST  II 
(Brian Gibson, USA 1986) and
SPECIES  (Roger  Donaldson,  USA  1995),  for  which  he 
designed an extraterrestrial beauty named “Sil”, ensured his 
reputation  and  have  made  him  a  leading  fgure  in  science 
fction and horror flm. 
Yet Giger’s flm career began earlier. In 1967, working with 
Fredi M. Murer, he realised his frst flm projects, HIGH and 
HEIMKILLER,  which  staged  his  own  works.  For  SWISS-
MADE 2069 (CH 1968), Giger created 
the  frst  monster  costume  from 
polyester vinyl. In 1976, for DUNE, a 
flm  project  planned  by  director 
Alejandro  Jodorowsky,  he  came  up 
with  a  variety  of   set  designs,  which, 
however,  were  not  incorporated  in 
the later flm version made by David 
Lynch (USA 1984). Also never realised 
were  his  fantastic  designs  for  the 
extraterrestrial  creatures  in  the 
horror  flm  project  THE  TOURIST 
or  for  the  Batmobile  in  BATMAN 
FOREVER  ( Joel  Schumacher,  USA 
1995). David Fincher’s ALIEN
3
 (USA 
1992)  returned  to  Giger’s  original 
designs; the popular creature also lives 
on in the numerous Aliens comics of  
the American publisher Dark Horse.

“How can I describe these scientifc precise chronicles, which are ripped of my body like single pages [...] Our prescientifc language 
 knows only few terms to convey the gruesome, awesome facts which Giger reveals to us. [...] Giger, you see more than we domestic
primates.“                                   Timothy Leary
       The exhibition presents, for the frst time 
worldwide,  a  comprehensive  selection  of   the  flm-related 
works of  HR Giger. The artist himself  is closely involved in its 
planning.  In  addition  to  numerous  sketches  and  designs,  the 
show  also  includes  sculptures  such  as  “Humanoid”  from 
SWISSMADE and one of  the “Harkonnen” chairs that Giger 
designed for DUNE. Central areas of  the show are dedicated 
to  ALIEN,  ALIEN

exhibition displays the most important design blueprints of  the

three-dimensional special-efects props and parts of  costumes, 
including heads and models of  the ALIEN creature, as well as 
the suit and a transparent bust of  Sil from SPECIES. Photos, 
posters, reviews, fan letters, promotional material, comics and 
merchandise  articles  illustrate  the  global  reception  of   the 
ALIEN design in particular. 
Several video stations and wall projections are integrated into 
the  exhibition,  allowing  the  visitors  to  see  short  flms  and 
excerpts  from  movies  as  well  as  documentary  making-of  
material.  Created  exclusively  for  this  exhibition  is  a  flm 
interview with H. R. Giger, in which the artist comments on 
the central exhibits. 
The  show  is  designed  as  a  touring  exhibition,  and  after 
premiering  in  Frankfurt  am  Main  will  be  presented  at  other 
international museums and exhibition sites.

          The  exhibition  is  accompanied  by  a  richly 
illustrated  publication,  in  which  various  authors  consider  the 
work of  H. R. Giger from the perspective of  art history, flm 
studies,  and  cultural  studies.  Individual  essays  examine  the 
historical connections to classics of  Expressionist flm such as 
DAS CABINET DES DR. CALIGARI (Robert Wiene, D 1919/20) 
and  NOSFERATU  (Friedrich  Wilhelm  Murnau,  D  1921)  and 
present  additional  flms  about  hybrid  or  android  lifeforms, 
such  as  the  replicants  from  BLADE  RUNNER  (Ridley  Scott, 
USA  1982),  the  cyborg  ROBOCOP  (Paul  Verhoeven,  USA 
1987)  or  James  Cameron’s  TERMINATOR  (USA  1984). 
Further, the authors go into the relationship of  Giger’s work to 
fantastic art, Surrealism and Symbolism, as well as considering 
the  infuences  of   modern  developments  in  medicine  and 
biomechanics.  A  detailed  appendix  contains  a  biography, 
bibliography  and  flmography,  as  well  as  a  list  of   flm-related 
works.  The  approximately  200-page  catalogue  will  be 
published in both a German and an English version.

“I see my work for flm as the continuation of  the same creative process that also brings forth my art. [...]
It may surprise the people in Hollywood, but I have never seen myself  as a monster maker.“        HR Giger
