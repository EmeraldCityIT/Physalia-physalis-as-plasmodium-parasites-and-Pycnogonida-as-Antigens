<p>The female Physalia Physalis plasmodial parasite (Portuguese man o war) carries reproductive organs in her tentacles called cnidocytes. Female cnidocytes are used to mate with the gonopores of the male physalia physalis phage/virus/antigen (Pycnogonida). Antigens are born as the nematocysts of the physalia physalis which grow 2 or 3 feet in diameter. A major conspiracy and coverup behind AIDS is that many patients die when they are killed by hospitals to prevent infection, as pycnogonida literally leap out of the victim's bodily openings.</p>

<p>A widespread viral outbreak in the 80's was discovered and called HIV and AIDS, today scientists who do not understand the multiple stages of pycnogonida (antigens), mulching, and physalia physalis (plasmodium parasites) label the virus differently when discovered in new regions. In Africa terms like Malaria and Small Pox are used, a current epidemic in China is being called Coronavirus, and Many cases in America are now being called Eastern Equestrian Encephalitis or multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Upon fertilization by mating, Male and female counterparts are formed together as Nematocysts within Cnidocytes in the female's tentacles. During larval stages, while still within the mother's Nematocysts, the larvae is weaponized and used to attack and parasitically infect prey. When the Nematocysts outgrow the Cnidocytes of the mother, they are released into the ocean to begin a new lifecycle.</p>

# Antigen viruses cause demyelination

Viruses that cause demyelination deteriorate the protective layers of the nervous system to gain semi-control of the host. Most coronavirus deaths are associated with an infected host being killed for displaying erratic behavior which prohibits contained treatment and causes a danger to others. Antigen parasites literally take over your body and build chemical connections to neural pathways using appendages called ovigers. Some diseases really come down to mental.

# Natural Female Biology (plasmodium parasites)

Inspect the video thumbnail below before you press play. Within the clear tentacles of the physalia physalis are highly visible nematocysts (pycnogonida).

The female Physalia with her shell resembles a common Pycnogonid Sea Spider. Males rip the shell and eyes off of females (often in utero) to inhibit movement, fully expose her gonopores, and to enforce dominance. The result of a female Physalia Physalis's shell being removed is the Portuguese man o war "Jellyfish" creature. The female's blatter expands without a protective covering and the creature is forced to the top of the ocean.

Without an exoskeleton to anchor her muscles to, the female Physalia is unable to move freely. The exposed Physalia lacks any protection and must use her gonopores and train her young as her only defense. Her gonomores which once transferred her eggs into the mail are now used to inject them into any creature she comes across. Gonopores are used as Cnidocytes and male Physalia Physalis Nematocysts are ejected into new hosts. Host cells die and the virus moves onto a healthy target.

# Natural Male Biology (Virus Protein Antigens)

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/CORONAVIRUS.png)

An extinction-level event arrises in the fact that as larvae Nematocysts, the Physalia Physalis is grown as a weapon used to inject itself into a target prey. Fully Grown Physalia Physalis resemble large, tailed sea spiders and are known to seek out and parasitically infect mammals on land including humans. Through the evolution of weaponized infancy, the fully grown male Physalia Physalis is able to navigate, track and gain entry into a human host as part of it's a natural cycle. Openings such as mouth, throat, anal cavity and Vagina are used to gain entry into a targeted host.

# Tritium Production in Lithium Based Life Forms

Physalia Physalis is a lithium based life form which digests it's prey using an organic form of tritium found withing it's digestive system. Physalis physalis uses sunlight produce tritium from lithium. Pycnogonida will seek out light to produce this digestive chemical and if a lack of light exists the species will remain tophagous. The species is naturally radioactive and destroys soft tissue in the body in a process called Demyelination. RNA sized phage viruses re-arrange DNA and replicate dead tissue using genetically modified proteins.

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/10967_2018_6022_Fig3_HTML.jpg)

High concentrations of tritium found within the physalia physalis create biological weaknesses within the species. Physalia physalis are repelled from positively charged metals and many substances. Positively charged metals act as a hyper-cathode to plasmodium parasites, and antigens becoming radioactive to their lattice structure.

# The Truth About Nuclear Energy

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/Nuclear-Reactor.jpg)

Nuclear reactors currently in operation are various designs for farming pycnogonida and harvesting Tritium. Tritium is collected in pools which are connected to copper cables which run to power companies. Pools are often makeshift or commercially available materials filled with Tritium, with a copper cable that simply runs the length of tunnel to nearby power station.

"As the solution loses power, we siphon off the bottom layers, and add new layer to the top.We see that the newer layer always floats to the top, so we know that it works. -Stenson Jefry"

* Q. Why is the cable at the bottom if all the power is at the top. Aren't you just losing electrons to the rest of the environment?

* A. I'll have one of our physicists look at it.

# Mulching and Meltdowns

Large Breed Reactors consist of large pycnogida housed in anethstetic towers. When conditions are met that create mulching of the pycnogonida's shell, a meltdown occurs and the physalia physalis often comes apart from it's containment vessel as a large plasmodium parasite.

# Weaponization

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/physalia-physalis-virus/Screen_Shot_2020-01-28_at_54415_PM.png)

Physalia physalis nematocysts are known as phage viruses and have been studied since the 1974 when a piece of building material from Boston harbor was sent to scientist Ronald Bauerman and was found with strange spiders in it's containment bag. Physalia Physalis has a long lifespan and grows extremely large. Physalia physalis has been studied by many laboratories for it's ability to parasitically infect a population and take instruction.

The male Physalia Physalis resembles a pycnogonid species and also carries reproductive organs (gonopores) in his appendages or legs. As the physalia physalis pycnogonid Nematocysts grow within a host, the victim will suffer 'drug withdrawal' like symptoms and neurological symptoms that include urges to feed on other humans. Cannibalistic symptoms are caused by the parasite's urges to feed on new human hosts and victims will often go to great lengths to curb new addiction withdrawl symptoms brought on by the parasite.

The entire operational culture of the Physalia Physalis consists of death via parasitic infection. Once the parasite gains control over a host, it's priority is to feed and gain control over it's targeted population. Humans become vessels in which to milk resources such as flesh, bodily fluids, and reproductive functions. Mind control is used to encourage grotesque acts like human processing (brokering human flesh), human machining (deboning), cannibalism, human sex trafficking, child pedophilia, human manufacturing (forced mechanical labor), geopolitical takeovers, covert military operations, assassinations, zombie infestations, necron culture, etc.

# Demonic Possession and Human Harvesting (Equine Encephalitis)

Humans are harvested and taken apart like machinery at a scrap yard, women are cut open at the midsection to expose their womb for forced mechanical breeding while calcium (milk), and iron (blood) are harvested from the mother host. Other grotesque borg manifestations were seen in Seattle, during Operation American Watchdog 2016 when Seattle Police officer Margaret Johnson built a "kidney tree" in hanger A7 using kidneys harvested from multiple victims at the port and Laboratory scaffolding. Margaret stated before launching a bright strike attack "the kidney tree was a very temporary habitat to keep her borg happy."

# Xenopsychology

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/Screen_Shot_2019-12-15_at_111052_PM.png)

Pycnogonids see vision and color based on elemental hues and identify metals, alloys, and composites in all material on sight. Pycnogonids are able to detect metal concentrations in organic flesh. Physalia Physalis Pycnogonid views everything containing metal elements (ex: Calcium, Iron in blood, etc.) as machinery, this is their viewpoint, this is their understanding. The exoskeleton is a "metal covering" in the life of a Pycnogonid which views itself as a cyborg, or "fusion" between living beings and metal. The creature's main objective upon discovering any new living body is to rip it apart and scavenge its parts. The species' intention is to feed on modified biological entities created from parts of multiple hosts. Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids collect and harvest hosts like a collection of machines. Male Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids use their venomous enzymes to numb their host's insides and disguise their movement within the victim's body. De-shelled females use the toxin to disable their prey in water. Physalia Physalis main predatorial tactic is to force their host to submit to their will like a robot which they call cyborg or "borg".
