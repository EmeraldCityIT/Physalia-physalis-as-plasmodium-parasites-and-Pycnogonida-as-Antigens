<p>The female Physalia Physalis plasmodial parasite (Portuguese man o war) carries reproductive organs in her tentacles called cnidocytes. Female cnidocytes are used to mate with the gonopores of the male physalia physalis phage/virus/antigen (Pycnogonida). Antigens are born as the nematocysts of the physalia physalis which grow 2 or 3 feet in diameter. A major conspiracy and coverup behind AIDS is that many patients die when they are killed by hospitals to prevent infection, as pycnogonida literally leap out of the victim's bodily openings.</p>

<p>A widespread viral outbreak in the 80's was discovered and called HIV and AIDS, today scientists who do not understand the multiple stages of pycnogonida (antigens), mulching, and physalia physalis (plasmodium parasites) label the virus differently when discovered in new regions. In Africa terms like Malaria and Small Pox are used, a current epidemic in China is being called Coronavirus, and Many cases in America are now being called Eastern Equestrian Encephalitis or multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Upon fertilization by mating, Male and female counterparts are formed together as Nematocysts within Cnidocytes in the female's tentacles. During larval stages, while still within the mother's Nematocysts, the larvae is weaponized and used to attack and parasitically infect prey. When the Nematocysts outgrow the Cnidocytes of the mother, they are released into the ocean to begin a new lifecycle.</p>
