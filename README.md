# Extinction-Level-Event-by-Physalia-Physalis
The female Physalia Physalis (portuguese man o war) carries reproductive organs in her tenticles which are used to mate with the elusive male counterpart. The male Physalia Physalis resemples a pycnogonid species and also carries reproductive organs in his appendages or legs. Upon fertilication by mating, Male and female counterparts are formed together as Nematocysts within Cnidocytes in the female's tentacles. During larval stages, while still within the mother's Nematocysts, the larvae is weaponized and used to attack and parasetically infect prey. When the Nematocysts outgrow the Cnidocytes of the mother, they are released into the ocean to begin a new lifecycle. 

Theories of male and female seperation include:

1. Males are used during the sting process, females are released into ocean.

2. Males seperate from females after reaching sexual maturity and fertilizing the female.

3. During Mating Males fertilize the female as well as any larvae she already carries.


An extinction level event arrises in the fact that as larvae Nematocysts, the Physalia Physalis is grown as a weapon used to inject inself into a target prey. Fully Grown Physalia Physalis resemple large, tailed sea spiders and are known to seek out and parasetically infect mammals on land including humans. Through evolution of weaponized infantcy, the fully grown male Physalia Physalis is able to navigate, track and gain entry into a human host as part of it's natural cycle. Openings such as mouth, throat, anal cavity and Vagina are used to gain entry into a targeted host.

Verified Characteristics:

The Physalia Physalis are hyper intelligent. 

The Physalia Physalis's only motive is to maintain dominance in the food chain.

The Physalia Physalis eat Human, Cat, Whale, Tauran, "you if you let them" -Starfleet Command

Physalia Physalis eat the most active, or most hyper individuals.

Physalia Physalis build chemical connections "staples" with organisms they infect.

Chemical connections remain even if physical bonds occure.

Male and female Physalia Physalis remain chemically bonded after split.

Mother and infant Physalia Physalis remain chemically connected after physical seperation.

Chemical connections are used for communication.

Humans are highly sensetive to chemical bonds.
