# Extinction-Level-Event-by-Physalia-Physalis
The female Physalia Physalis (Portuguese man o war) carries reproductive organs in her tentacles which are used to mate with the elusive male counterpart. The male Physalia Physalis resembles a pycnogonid species and also carries reproductive organs in his appendages or legs. Upon fertilisation by mating, Male and female counterparts are formed together as Nematocysts within Cnidocytes in the female's tentacles. During larval stages, while still within the mother's Nematocysts, the larvae is weaponized and used to attack and parasitically infect prey. When the Nematocysts outgrow the Cnidocytes of the mother, they are released into the ocean to begin a new lifecycle.

Males rip the shell and eyes off of females to inhibid movement, fully expose her gonopores and to enforce dominance. The result of a female Physalia Physalis's shell being removed is the portuguese man o war "Jellyfish" creature. The female's blatter expands without a protective covering and the creature is forced to the top of the ocean. The female physalia without shell removed resembles a common Pycnogonid Sea Spider.

An extinction-level event arrises in the fact that as larvae Nematocysts, the Physalia Physalis is grown as a weapon used to inject itself into a target prey. Fully Grown Physalia Physalis resemble large, tailed sea spiders and are known to seek out and parasitically infect mammals on land including humans. Through the evolution of weaponized infancy, the fully grown male Physalia Physalis is able to navigate, track and gain entry into a human host as part of it's a natural cycle. Openings such as mouth, throat, anal cavity and Vagina are used to gain entry into a targeted host.

Verified Characteristics:

1. The Physalia Physalis are hyper-intelligent.

2. Physalia Physalis's only motive is to maintain dominance in the food chain.

3. The Physalia Physalis eat Human, Cat, Whale, Tauran, "you if you let them" -Starfleet Command

4. Physalia Physalis eat the most active, or most hyper individuals.

5. Physalia Physalis build chemical connections "staples" with organisms they infect.

6. Chemical connections remain even if physical bonds are broken.

7. Male and female Physalia Physalis remain chemically bonded after a split.

8. Mother and infant Physalia Physalis remain chemically connected after physical separation.

9. Chemical connections are used for communication.

10. Humans are highly sensitive to chemical bonds.

11. If a Physalia Physalis has a chance to act like a parasite, it will take it.

12. Physalia Physalis can live in humans until they are too large for their host.

13. Physalia Physalis will communicate with their hosts.

14. Physalia Physalis will threaten their hosts.

15. Physalia Physalis only wants to eat.

16. Physalia Physalis only communicates to get food.

17. Physalia Physalis are hyper-intelligent manipulators.

18. Physalia Physalis will attack the heart and organs.

19. Physalia Physalis will encourage human cannibalism to support their appetite.

20. Physalia Physalis have sex with organs of hosts.

21. Cancers are polyps that form from Physalia mating habits.

22. Tumors are the seed of the male Physalia Physalis.

23. The organ trafficking and transplant industry is fueled by hosts of the Physalia Physalis.

24. Male Physalia Physalis rip the shells and eyes from their female counterparts to inhibit hovement and enforce control, they treat humans worse than their own kind.

25. Zinc components are toxicly radioactive to Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids.

26. Silver components are toxicly radioactive to Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids.

27. Aluminum components are toxicly radioactive to Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids. Aluminum is less toxic than Silver.

28. Bronze is less toxic to Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids than Aluminum but still lethal to touch.

29. Alkyd Paint destroys pycnogonid chemical sensors and quantum bonds by destroying chemical bonds

30. Pycnogonids will stay away from machinery with a lot of aluminum and plastic coverings

31. Exposed copper is a primary target of Pycnogonids

32. Exposed pipes are a primary target of Pycnogonids

33. Plastic coverings are a deterant of Pycnogonids

34. Pycnogonids can read

35. The word aluminum is a derent to Pycnogonids

The Pycnogonids fly egg-shaped craft containing human hosts hundreds of thousands of kidnapped humans contained in stasis undiced by blood harvesting. The color of the craft has been identified as "tooth yellow" and has a clear dome on the upper aft portion. The crafts hover above the ocean at underwater stations, and a red tail attaches to some type of deep-sea cable which has been identified as leading to Antarctica.
