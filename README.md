![Physalia Physalis Invasion Alert](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/invasion-gundam-news.png)

<p>The female Physalia Physalis plasmodial parasite (Portuguese man o war) carries reproductive organs in her tentacles called cnidocytes. Female cnidocytes are used to mate with the gonopores of the male physalia physalis phage/virus/antigen (Pycnogonida). Antigens are born as the nematocysts of the physalia physalis which grow 2 or 3 feet in diameter. A major conspiracy and coverup behind AIDS is that many patients die when they are killed by hospitals to prevent infection, as pycnogonida literally leap out of the victim's bodily openings.</p>

<p>A widespread viral outbreak in the 80's was discovered and called HIV and AIDS, today scientists who do not understand the multiple stages of pycnogonida (antigens), mulching, and physalia physalis (plasmodium parasites) label the virus differently when discovered in new regions. In Africa terms like Malaria and Small Pox are used, a current epidemic in China is being called Coronavirus, and Many cases in America are now being called Eastern Equestrian Encephalitis or multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Upon fertilization by mating, Male and female counterparts are formed together as Nematocysts within Cnidocytes in the female's tentacles. During larval stages, while still within the mother's Nematocysts, the larvae is weaponized and used to attack and parasitically infect prey. When the Nematocysts outgrow the Cnidocytes of the mother, they are released into the ocean to begin a new lifecycle.</p>

# Antigen viruses cause demyelination

Viruses that cause demyelination deteriorate the protective layers of the nervous system to gain semi-control of the host. Most coronavirus deaths are associated with an infected host being killed for displaying erratic behavior which prohibits contained treatment and causes a danger to others. Antigen parasites literally take over your body and build chemical connections to neural pathways using appendages called ovigers. Some diseases really come down to mental.

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/symptoms-of-aquired-parasites.png)

# What are "Aquired Diseases"?

Some parasites have the ability to eat through the protective layering (myelin) of a host's nervous system. These parasites eat away the protective layer of neurons and use their ovigers to interact with the nervous system of their host. An acquired disease is a parasite that has permeated a host's myelin and gained semi-control of the decision-making abilities of the host after infection. Community acquired diseases are wide-spread myelin penetrating parasites that effect decision making of entire communities.

Aquired diseases are often weaponized and used as a form of propaganda or brain washing by a controller. Community aquirered diseases are a form of control that is capable of overthrowing entire nations, planets, and solar systems. This is a confirmed tactic of the Military of the People's Republic of China, Pleiadians, and OOCL.

# Fight Demyelination

Creatine is a clean, effective, and immediate weapon against antigen viruses. Consuming Creatine allows the body to immediately recover damaged tissue and is used by body builders for muscles and ligaments. Collagen and Calcium rebuild damage caused by demyelination and create stronger neural myelin tissues within the nervous system. Zinc, horsradish, and tumeric are is the most affordable supplements to remove antigens which cause demyelination.

# Natural Female Biology (plasmodium parasites)

Inspect the video thumbnail below before you press play. Within the clear tentacles of the physalia physalis are highly visible nematocysts (pycnogonida).

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/5856_lorespreview.jpg)

The female Physalia with her shell resembles a common Pycnogonid Sea Spider. Males rip the shell and eyes off of females (often in utero) to inhibit movement, fully expose her gonopores, and to enforce dominance. The result of a female Physalia Physalis's shell being removed is the Portuguese man o war "Jellyfish" creature. The female's blatter expands without a protective covering and the creature is forced to the top of the ocean.

![Physalia Physalis plasmodium parasite](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/Malaria_plasmodium_falciparum.jpg)

Without an exoskeleton to anchor her muscles to, the female Physalia is unable to move freely. The exposed Physalia lacks any protection and must use her gonopores and train her young as her only defense. Her gonomores which once transferred her eggs into the mail are now used to inject them into any creature she comes across. Gonopores are used as Cnidocytes and male Physalia Physalis Nematocysts are ejected into new hosts. Host cells die and the virus moves onto a healthy target.

# Natural Male Biology (Virus Protein Antigens)

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/CORONAVIRUS.png)

An extinction-level event arrises in the fact that as larvae Nematocysts, the Physalia Physalis is grown as a weapon used to inject itself into a target prey. Fully Grown Physalia Physalis resemble large, tailed sea spiders and are known to seek out and parasitically infect mammals on land including humans. Through the evolution of weaponized infancy, the fully grown male Physalia Physalis is able to navigate, track and gain entry into a human host as part of it's a natural cycle. Openings such as mouth, throat, anal cavity and Vagina are used to gain entry into a targeted host.

# Tritium Production in Lithium Based Life Forms

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/Tritium-oxide-2D.png)

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/440px-Water_molecule_3Dsvg.png)

Physalia Physalis is a lithium based life form which digests it's prey using an organic form of tritium found withing it's digestive system. Physalis physalis uses sunlight produce tritium from lithium. Pycnogonida will seek out light to produce this digestive chemical and if a lack of light exists the species will remain tophagous. The species is naturally radioactive and destroys soft tissue in the body in a process called Demyelination. RNA sized phage viruses re-arrange DNA and replicate dead tissue using genetically modified proteins.

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/10967_2018_6022_Fig3_HTML.jpg)

High concentrations of tritium found within the physalia physalis create biological weaknesses within the species. Physalia physalis are repelled from positively charged metals and many substances. Positively charged metals act as a hyper-cathode to plasmodium parasites, and antigens becoming radioactive to their lattice structure.

# The Truth About Nuclear Energy

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/Nuclear-Reactor.jpg)

Nuclear reactors currently in operation are various designs for farming pycnogonida and harvesting Tritium. Tritium is collected in pools which are connected to copper cables which run to power companies. Pools are often makeshift or commercially available materials filled with Tritium, with a copper cable that simply runs the length of tunnel to nearby power station.

"As the solution loses power, we siphon off the bottom layers, and add new layer to the top.We see that the newer layer always floats to the top, so we know that it works. -Stenson Jefry"

* Q. Why is the cable at the bottom if all the power is at the top. Aren't you just losing electrons to the rest of the environment?

* A. I'll have one of our physicists look at it.

# Mulching and Meltdowns

Large Breed Reactors consist of large pycnogida housed in anethstetic towers. When conditions are met that create mulching of the pycnogonida's shell, a meltdown occurs and the physalia physalis often comes apart from it's containment vessel as a large plasmodium parasite.

# Weaponization

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/physalia-physalis-virus/Screen_Shot_2020-01-28_at_54415_PM.png)

Physalia physalis nematocysts are known as phage viruses and have been studied since the 1974 when a piece of building material from Boston harbor was sent to scientist Ronald Bauerman and was found with strange spiders in it's containment bag. Physalia Physalis has a long lifespan and grows extremely large. Physalia physalis has been studied by many laboratories for it's ability to parasitically infect a population and take instruction.

The male Physalia Physalis resembles a pycnogonid species and also carries reproductive organs (gonopores) in his appendages or legs. As the physalia physalis pycnogonid Nematocysts grow within a host, the victim will suffer 'drug withdrawal' like symptoms and neurological symptoms that include urges to feed on other humans. Cannibalistic symptoms are caused by the parasite's urges to feed on new human hosts and victims will often go to great lengths to curb new addiction withdrawl symptoms brought on by the parasite.

The entire operational culture of the Physalia Physalis consists of death via parasitic infection. Once the parasite gains control over a host, it's priority is to feed and gain control over it's targeted population. Humans become vessels in which to milk resources such as flesh, bodily fluids, and reproductive functions. Mind control is used to encourage grotesque acts like human processing (brokering human flesh), human machining (deboning), cannibalism, human sex trafficking, child pedophilia, human manufacturing (forced mechanical labor), geopolitical takeovers, covert military operations, assassinations, zombie infestations, necron culture, etc.

# Demonic Possession and Human Harvesting (Equine Encephalitis)

Humans are harvested and taken apart like machinery at a scrap yard, women are cut open at the midsection to expose their womb for forced mechanical breeding while calcium (milk), and iron (blood) are harvested from the mother host. Other grotesque borg manifestations were seen in Seattle, during Operation American Watchdog 2016 when Seattle Police officer Margaret Johnson built a "kidney tree" in hanger A7 using kidneys harvested from multiple victims at the port and Laboratory scaffolding. Margaret stated before launching a bright strike attack "the kidney tree was a very temporary habitat to keep her borg happy."

# Xenopsychology

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/Screen_Shot_2019-12-15_at_111052_PM.png)

Pycnogonids see vision and color based on elemental hues and identify metals, alloys, and composites in all material on sight. Pycnogonids are able to detect metal concentrations in organic flesh. Physalia Physalis Pycnogonida view everything containing metal elements (ex: Calcium, Iron in blood, etc.) as machinery, this is their viewpoint, this is their understanding. The exoskeleton is a "metal covering" in the life of a Pycnogonid which views itself as a cyborg, or "fusion" between living beings and metal. The creature's main objective upon discovering any new living body is to rip it apart and scavenge its parts. The species' intention is to feed on modified biological entities created from parts of multiple hosts. Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids collect and harvest hosts like a collection of machines. Male Physalia Physalis Pycnogonids use their venomous enzymes to numb their host's insides and disguise their movement within the victim's body. De-shelled females use the toxin to disable their prey in water. Physalia Physalis main predatorial tactic is to force their host to submit to their will like a robot which they call cyborg or "borg".

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Biology in Retrospect, 3rd Party Microscopy, and Virus Protein Sampling:  

Reviewing Large Breed Pycnogonida Data Offers New Perspectives on Microscopic Antigens: 

Biology in Retrospect uses new data, methods, and insight during sampling, investigating, and researching old virus discoveries. Biology in Retrospect reviews past experiments, outbreaks, and research documented by the scientists of our past generations. Documents, images, and data from decades, centuries, and even millennia ago are re-investigated using methods, knowledge, technology, and tools only available to current and future generations of scientists and engineers.    

Third-Party Microscopy uses digital imagery on high-resolution computer monitors to sample, compare, and observe the world's most lethal pathogens far from the risk of physical contact. Robots and other non-living, remotely operated machines in remote laboratories are used in third-party microscopy to perform dangerous tasks related to the handling of live samples including viruses, bacteria, and infection victims. Unified use of Biology in Retrospect, Third Party Microscopy, and Virus Protein Sampling are the basis of identifying all viruses, bacteria, infectious processes, and their symptoms in this research paper.   

Military records offer Navy video surveillance footage of large breed Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis at diameters over 10 meters, from nuclear tritium harvesting reactors. Investigation of Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis at such a large scale provides new data on breeding habits, live birth, hunting, and predatorial characteristics of viral species which have never been available to the human species. Storage of this data by electronic means provides science a reality checks on currently accepted theories:  

Microscopic Phage Viruses and Partially Reduced Plasmodium Parasites come from Large Pycnogonida and Partially Reduced Physalia Physalis.  

These perspectives allow modern science to understand virus absorption, vesicles, uncoating, fusion, and swarming. Using these observations, modern science can form new and much-needed theories for pandemic diseases and symptoms thereof which result from all genus of phage viruses and their subspecies of plasmodium parasites.  

Incidents of recorded Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis attacks provide a large scale and direct view of how these species breach a prey’s body cavities at a large scale and take residence as a lethal parasite to explain virus “absorption”.  

Documented cases of large-scale viruses taking residence in body cavities of infected hosts such as the throat, vagina, uterus cavity, anus, or colon provide a direct view of how microscopic viruses create “vesicles” in cells that have fallen victim to virus “absorption”.  

Recordings of large scale Pycnogonida specimen losing their hydrocarbonate polysaccharide exoskeleton, called the “membrane” or “Capsule” at the microscopic level provides a direct reference to how microscopic viruses become plasmodium parasites to explain the truth about virus “uncoating  

Recordings of both Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis releasing their spawn to infect a new host provide a direct view of how viruses spread throughout a recently infected host body or cell to explain the truth viral “load” in victims of lethal diseases.  

Recordings of large-scale Pycnogonida tophaphagously consuming prey provide a direct view of how microscopic viruses break down and ingest an infected host’s body and cells to explain the truth about virus “consumption”.  

Recordings of large-scale Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis leaving the body cavities of infected hosts, or phage viruses and Plasmodium parasites leaving cells at the microscopic level provide a direct view of how viruses burst from a dying body or cell to explain the truth about virus “swarming”.  

Of all these new explanations for functions of virus infection, the most breakthrough discovery may come from Recordings of intelligent and dexterous movement by the Pycnogonida species. Currently accepted theories of transmission being only possible by bodily fluids, physical contact, or aerial particles are broken by recordings of Pycnogonida leaving infected persons, hunting, tracking, stalking, and attacking healthy persons who are not protected by high-Ph body chemistry.  

Data on radioactive Tritium found within Pycnogonida provides breakthrough revelations on radiation sickness from Tritium being released by viruses into a parasitically infected host by the species as the real cause of most flu-like symptoms in victims of virus infection. While methods for removal of Tritium from a body are unknown, removal of a Parasitic infection by Pycnogonida is possible via alkaline boosting supplements. Most diseases and cancers are symptoms of a body being consumed by a parasitic infection by a Physalia physalis, while Tritium destroys a host’s cells and tissues.  

Biology in Retrospect explains why antioxidants and alkaline substances have been used by holistic healers for millennia to successfully support good health and fight off diseases. Over-the-counter herbs, vitamins, and supplements are used to create a high-Ph environment within the body of any participant. Oxidized, acidic viruses dissolve and cook off via REDOX reactions in any alkaline, high-Ph environment, Research shows that turning the human body into a reducing agent removes any possibility of being infected by a virus such as a phage or a plasmodium parasite. Previously incurable diseases have been removed from infected persons within six months of converting to a high-Ph Alkaline biosystem. 

Pycnogonida and Phage Virus Stereochemistry:   

Pycnognida are large-breed Phage Viruses 

All variants of the Phage Virus species are infant spawns of Pycnogonida. The Pycnogonida is a Tophaphagous aquatic crustacean. Various species of the Pycnogonida survive by hunting warm-blooded creatures. A Pycnogonida will consume prey that is smaller than itself using powerful jaws to break flesh and drain bodily fluids.  

A Pycnogonida enters prey larger than itself via available body cavities such as the mouth, nostril, genitalia, anus, eyes, ears, or via penetration of the epidermal layer. Once inside a targeted prey, a Pycnogonida attaches itself to internal organs and survives as a parasite. Once a Pycnogonida enters a targeted host, the species reproduces rapidly at an exponential rate. Spawn of Pycnogonida parasites reproduce at a rate that most host species cannot fight off via a natural immune system response.  

The Pycnogonida species, commonly called the spider crab consists of a crustaceous body with an exoskeleton composed of a sugary carbohydrate. In 1917 Oswald Avery of the Rockefeller institute first discovered that some pneumococci were surrounded by a capsule of polysaccharides, a pure carbohydrate sugar shell. In Avery’s first research paper on the subject, he investigated these “specific soluble substances”.  

Crustaceous shells and Polysaccharide Capsules 

The crustaceous shell of the Pycnogonida is a polysaccharide capsule of the phage virus. In both the large breed Pycnogonida and the microscopic phage virus, the composition and stereochemistry of the lifeform is the same. The exoskeleton of the Pycnogonida is a low-Ph acetic sugar that provides physical protection to the internal gelatinous mass of the species. The exoskeleton becomes tempered at elevated temperatures and is extraordinarily strong. In a parasitic infection of Pycnogonida, the exoskeleton is nearly impenetrable to the immune system of a host. 

Although the exoskeleton of the Pycnogonida provides a great physical tensile strength, the chemical composition of low Ph acetic sugar carbohydrates is the species' primary weakness. In an alkaline environment, or when in contact with an alkaline substance, the polysaccharide capsule or exoskeleton of the Pycnogonida completely dissolves.  

Upon dissolution of the carbohydrate exoskeleton or polysaccharide capsule of the Pycnogonida species, a gelatinous globule of purple-colored mass of internal organs will remain. This purple gelatinous mass is the Physalia physalis, commonly known as the Portuguese Man O’ War. The Physalia physalis is the large breed of all plasmodium parasites.  

Oswald Avery, Rene Dubos, Michal Heidelberger, Fred Griffith, Michael Dawson, Colin Macleod, Maclyn McCarty, and other scientists during and after the great influenza outbreak of 1918 began the study of polysaccharide capsules in pneumococci. Avery coined the term “the sugar-coated microbe”. 

Pycnogonida Phage Viruses (PPV) 

Pycnogonida Phage Viruses (PPV) have a very defined physical shape and architecture. The octoped species has eight legs, with two legs on each of four body sections, one on each side. Each leg has five sections. Pycnogonida legs resemble the legs of a common crab from an outside appearance. The internal mechanics of the Pycnogonida share zero resemblance or common features with the common crab species.  

The large breed Pycnogonida and microscopic phage virus alike are highly advanced structures that have intricate coil groups which can only function as part of the encapsulated virus when anchored to specific points within the hydrocarbonate polysaccharide exoskeleton which exists at birth. The internal mass of the Pycnogonida produces tritium as a means to generate electrical pulses needed for the control of long coiled strands of gelatinous structures which act as the species' muscle groups. The Pycnogonida controls the expansion and contraction of coil groups anchored to exoskeleton sections with violent currents of electricity generated by beta radiation of electrons from radioactive tritium. The coil structures which are anchored to points within each section of the Pycnogonida's exoskeleton are alien to any other lifeform found on earth. The tritium-powered coils within the legs of a Pycnogonida act like powerful springs capable of launching a Pycnogonida virus up to 15 times the length of its leg span when traveling on land. 

The head of the Pycnogonida has other coil groups anchored to sections of the jaw and within the eye sockets. Jaws of the Pycnogonida are incredibly strong. On U.S. Navy vessels such as the USS Carl Vinson, large breed Pycnogonida viruses have been seen biting off the heads of sailors before picking up decapitated bodies and consuming the blood from the bleeding corpses. 

The Pycnogonida species has highly maneuverable arm-like appendages which protrude from behind the species’ head. The arm-like appendages called ovigars, have over 12 sections in each arm, each section anchoring several internal coils as muscle groups. The ovigars are used for delicate operations and possibly electrical signal communication via organs at the tips of the ovigar structures. 

A defining physical characteristic that can be used to quickly identify species of Pycnogonida from common crab species is a tail that protrudes from the rear end of the virus. The tail is a multi-sectional appendage that varies in construction and appearance throughout different variations of the Pycnogonida virus. While some species of Pycnogonida such as the HIV variant have defined electrical signal-producing organs at the tips of the tail, all variants use the internal coil structures anchored to sections of the exoskeleton for movement.  

“Transformation of Pneumococcal Types” theory by Oswald Avery 

During the great influenza of 1918, it was discovered that the immune system could not attack pneumococci surrounded by capsules, but easily destroyed pneumococci without capsules. Exactly one century before the worldwide epidemic of COVID-19, pneumococci with intact exoskeletons were growing rapidly in the lungs of their victims and killing within weeks, days, and even hours.  

In 1928 Fred Griffin published that pneumococcus without capsules were somehow “changing” into pneumococci with capsules. After developing Grave’s disease from working with infectious parasites largely unprotected, Avery developed the current theory on the transformation of pneumococci without capsules into pneumococci with capsules. In 1945 Oswald Avery and Colin McCloud published the paper “Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types. Induction of transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococci Type III” to the “Journal of Experimental Medicine”. 

Currently Accepted Theories Were Developed Using Antiquated Obsolete Methods. Modern Research, Data, and Methods Re-Evaluate Past Discoveries. Current theories for virus capsulization, absorption, uncoating, fusion, and viral swarms that result from these processes have been formed over a century using whatever microscopy humans had available to our species. Currently accepted theories of viral processes were formed by scientists training to view a microscopic biological process through a microscope while struggling to avoid infection by the virus which they studied. Modern scientists make breakthrough discoveries only with a strenuous volume of energy and mental capacity used to prevent virus outbreaks by using level 4 laboratories, hazmat suits, and numerous safety precautions. Past generations of scientists died of diseases which resulted from infections by the viruses they viewed through analog microscopes, largely unprotected.  

In 1928 Oswald Avery developed Grave’s disease during years of unprotected research into pneumococci. Avery at over 40 Years of age worked during the worst virus outbreak in modern world history. Avery worked in simplified labs with a single porcelain sink, worktables, Bunsen burners, racks of test tubes, mason jars, Petri dishes, droppers, pipettes, platinum loops, incubators, vacuum pumps, and centrifuges. During the great influenza outbreak, Avery performed all work on the same tabletop, incubating virus samples, inoculating animals, and bleeding or dissecting infected animals. Avery walked to the laboratory every day wearing the same grey jacket and changed into a light tan or white lab coat as his only protection. Avery’s assistant Rene Dubos observed that “He made little effort to follow modern trends in science … In the lab he was limited to a rather narrow range of techniques, which he rarely changed and to which he added little.”   

-Oswald Theodore Avery, 1877-1955 “Biological Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society (1956), 40. 

The current theory of the formation of Pneumococcus with capsules from those without capsules is accepted as “The inducing substance has been likened to a gene, and the capsular antigen which is produced in response to it has been regarded as a gene product”. The current theory accepted by modern science is that genes of pneumococcus are written to repair or grow new capsules, and that DNA just repairs the virus. Observations of large breed Pycnogonida provide modern scientists a better perspective on theories formed from over microscopes a century ago. Capsules cannot regrow on unencapsulated viruses (plasmodium parasites) to become re-encapsulated (Phage Viruses), but plasmodium parasite and phage viruses can breed many encapsulated viruses.  

In 1928 Fred Griffith published that when pneumococci without capsules were incubated with seemingly dead pneumococci with capsules intact, he believed that the pneumococci without capsules somehow transformed into pneumococci with capsules intact. Oswald Avery dedicated his life trying to figure out how specimens of pneumococci were transformed. 

“Exponential Reproduction Rate Growth in Virus Colonies" theory by Cory Hofstad 

When an alkaline environment or substance reduces the oxidized polysaccharide hydrocarbonate capsulized exoskeleton of the Pycnogonida, the internal mass which remains is the plasmodium parasite or Physalia physalis, commonly referred to as the Portuguese Man O’ War. In a liquid or aquatic environment, the coil structures which are externally visible in the Physalia physalis species immediately become intertwined in a randomly contorted mess. The randomly intertwined bundle of coils hangs from a balloon-like body which expands after losing the pressurized capsule or exoskeleton. These intertwined coil structures can be seen contracting and expanding beneath the surface of the water from the Physalia physalis.  

Sections of the Pycnogonida's legs, body, head, tail, and ovigars dissolve via REDOX reactions quickly within minutes when in contact with a reducing agent. Complex coil groups once anchored to points of the exoskeleton become one big hanging mess. The reduction of the Pycnogonida into the Physalia physalis can be performed easily in a level 4 laboratory and has been observed on Navy ships, in nuclear reactors, and in the natural environment of the Earth’s oceans. What has never been performed or observed in any laboratory, industrial, or the natural environment is the unraveling of tangled coils by the Physalia physalis and regrowth of an overly complex exoskeleton with anchoring points to each individual coil needed to support functions of movement, hunting, feeding, and life.   

Dissolving the oxidized shell, exoskeleton, or polysaccharide capsule of the large breed Pycnogonida or microscopic phage virus, leaving the large breed Physalia physalis or microscopic Plasmodium parasite is much like cracking the shell of an egg, removing the shell from the egg, and scrambling its contents and it just cannot be undone. The damage done to the coils and anchor points within the exoskeleton and the bloating of the bladder of the resulting Physalia physalis during a REDOX reaction is simply too violent to the delicate and complex structure of the species to ever grow back under and condition. Unknowing of the identity of the viruses they were studying as sea creatures Pycnogonida and Physalia physalis, scientists such as Oswald Avery and Fred Griffith published the current theory that pneumococci species whose capsule has been dissolved can somehow be observed under the microscope transforming into pneumococci with intact capsules.  

Modern Observations of Physalia Physalis without an oxidized exoskeleton of hydrocarbonate polysaccharide capsule have revealed that the birth of new spawns of Pycnogonida in the form of nematocysts is the only method available to produce specimen with an intact capsule from populations of the specimen without capsule. Physalia physalis give birth to new Pycnogonida with intact capsules in the form of nematocysts which spawn from select coils hanging from the blue-purple gelatinous mass. In a natural environment or laboratory tank, nematocysts hatch from gonopores within the exposed coils and fall to the seafloor or tank floor. Alternatively, coils that come in contact with a species of prey can inject nematocysts into a victim via a “sting” which allows the infant nematocysts to grow as a parasite infection, further spreading the species and continuing its lifespan.  

A Pycnogonida which loses its protective structure may release millions to billions of smaller Physalia physalis and Plasmodium parasites which may simultaneously lose their protective structures from contact with a common reducing agent. Each generation of damaged Physalia physalis has within its reproductive coils, new generations of intact Pycnogonida. Larval Pycnogonida within Physalia physalis reproductive coils are called Nematocysts.  

Each generation of Pycnogonida produces new spawns from its gonopores, simultaneously. This biological method of exponential reproduction is how viruses spread so far and so fast in short periods. A large breed of Pycnogonida enters a host-prey and immediately releases all generations of spawn into the victim’s body to spread, grow, and reproduce. This method of parasitic infection is highly effective at surviving on a host’s blood, and organs until the species can be spread throughout the host species’ population. 

Between 1921 and 1945 scientists believed they were seeing a transformation of pneumococci without capsules into pneumococci with capsules during lab experiments. Modern observations made in laboratories, industrial, military, and natural environments show what in fact, pneumococci without capsules seen by scientists like Oswald Avery and Fred Griffith were spawning new Pycnogonida as phage viruses before being decayed and broken down by death. A transformation of viral cells was not a reality. A cycle of birth to new generations of virus cells before death and decay following the natural cycle is the truth and a quite common reality among living populations of species. 

Virus Math (V0.1) 

In an intact Pycnogonida, specialized coils lead to gonopores in the legs of the species. Gonopores are exposed openings that give birth to exponentially polyping generations of new Pycnogonida. A single gonopore exists on each section of every leg, between each joint. With eight legs, each having five sections, the Pycnogonida has 40 gonopores. Every gonopore can simultaneously spawn a single Pycnogonida. Every generation of newly spawned Pycnogonida grows from its parent's gonopores until it is released, often occurring only in the presence of survivable habitat or targeted host for parasite invasion. Each generation of spawned Pycnogonida is capable of spawning newer generations from its gonopores, even while still attached and growing from its own parent’s leg.  

In effect, a first-generation Pycnogonida with a 3-meter leg span may spawn 40 attached Pycnogonida offspring with leg spans of 2 decimeters. 40 second-generation 2dm Pycnogonida may simultaneously spawn 1600 attached Pycnogonida with a 2cm leg span. The 1600 third-generation Pycnogonida may spawn 64,000 attached Pycnogonida with a 2mm leg span. The 64,000 fourth-generation Pycnogonida may spawn 2,560,000 attached Pycnogonida with a 200-micrometer leg span. The 2,560,000 fifth-generation Pycnogonida may spawn 102,400,000 attached Pycnogonida with a leg span of 20 micrometers. The 102,400,000 sixth-generation Pycnogonida may spawn 4,096,000,000 Phage virus sized Pycnogonida.  

To learn what viruses were doing I developed my theories from Pycnogonida I saw in industrial environments 

The currently accepted theory of what a virus is has been formed and accepted via past generations of an ever-evolving field of Microscopy. Science accepts the virus as a spherical membrane covered by numerous protuberances which come in two shapes. One shape is referred to as a spike and the other shape is referred to as something like a small bundle.  

Stereochemistry developed by past scientists using now obsolete and antiquated microscopy techniques and equipment provides inadequate resolution to advanced lifeforms. Intricate proteins can only be observed as spikes, cones, blocks, pyramids, mushrooms, hydras, umbrellas, ribbons, and spheres under the inadequate view of obsolete microscopy. Scientists inaccurately accept that these shapes floating around the body are the key to virus protein binding and that if the shapes match, then only can infection take place. Current scientific theory accepts that these spherical cells and protuberances found under microscopes are all part of a single species. Biology in Retrospect proposes to science and modern medicine the fact that we are looking at a spherical cell being absorbed by octoped phage viruses and plasmodium parasites.  

Biology in Retrospect, Third Party Microscopy, and methods of virus protein sampling thereof allow scientists and engineers of all fields to take their time in collaboratively identifying features and characteristics of virus proteins far from the mental distractions of working in hazardous material laboratories. Reviewing stereochemistry from large dimensions and high-resolution microscopy provides new insights into what these shapes represent.  

Thorough investigations of archived diseases, parasites, and infectious viruses using modern technology are being compared to recordings of Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis from all angles. The previously described protuberance-covered spherical proteins once thought of as the virus itself have now been broken down into a reality of individual parts. The spherical membrane itself is not a part of any virus and instead represents a once healthy cell being attacked by phage viruses and plasmodium parasites. These phages and parasites which have been absorbed to the outside of a targeted cell have been viewed for decades by scientists as protuberances belonging to the sphere.  

Matching Phages to Pycnogonida 

The claw-tipped legs of the phages extending and reaching out from viruses clinging to a targeted cell have been viewed by past scientists as hemagglutinin or spiked-shaped Type-A protuberances. The drifting bladders of partially REDOXed plasmodium parasites clinging to a targeted cell by microscopic coils which were once contained by polysaccharide capsules have been viewed by past scientists as Tree-Shaped Type-B protuberances. When viewed as one complete image, the spherical membrane covered in protuberances is in reality a spherical cell that has fallen victim to parasitic infection via absorption of Phage viruses and plasmodium parasites.  

The shape and color of Pycnogonida are only relevant to identifying the species-genus. Like dogs and cats, Pycnogonida come in varying shapes, sizes, and levels of aggression. Type A Viruses are typically Pycnogonida with a deeper hue or color. Type B viruses are typically Pycnogonida with a lighter hue or color. For example, black and deep red Pycnogonida are far more aggressive than light orange or beige species. Pycnogonida with more intricate anatomy generally poses a higher level of intelligence and are more evolved. Higher evolution in Pycnogonida species leads to viruses that are more lethal and harder to kill.  

Pycnogonida Phage Viruses are alive and intelligent 

Many scientists inaccurately believe that viruses are the only living species in the universe which does not feed or use oxygen, do not have any metabolic process, do not produce waste, do not mate, and do not reproduce. Until now, science has accepted that viruses are not a living organism, not a collection of chemicals, but something in between. Scientists believe that whatever they are, viruses invade cells and somehow force the invaded cell to produce new viruses by somehow changing the cell’s genes.  

The reality is that viruses are species of Pycnogonida that invade bodies, parasitically feed on their host and spawn new generations until the host is dead while spreading to any new body which the host encounters. At the microscopic level, phage viruses invade cells, parasitically feed on the host cell and spawn new generations until the cell is dead while spreading to any new cell which the host cell encounters. Investigating disease and virus infection from this perspective provides future scientists and medical professionals work on finding ways to kill viruses and prevent infection without straining to understand what they are looking at through a microscope. What will kill a full-sized Pycnogonida and keep a human alive, will kill a virus infection in a human.  

Vaccines trigger the body’s natural defenses with weakened viruses 

Current strategies of virus vaccination promote the injection of viruses into the body with the theory that the recipient’s body will learn the shape of the Pycnogonida and how to use shapes to fight off viral infection. Never in recorded history has any specific shape ever killed a Pycnogonida. In reality, weakened viruses injected during vaccination only help fight the virus infection by alerting the body to a viral attack by the presence of injected antigens and triggering a buildup of white blood cells prepared to fight viruses which the vaccinated person may or may not come in contact with. If a vaccinated person’s immune system does not respond in this manner, the individual may die or become extremely ill.  

The process of transmission, spread, and outbreak:  

Infections in reproductive organs of men and women have been published by modern science and medicine as only capable of transmission via the transfer of bodily fluids. In reality, viruses that create vesicles within reproductive organs are not limited to transfer via bodily fluid, blood to blood contact, or sexual transmission. Although microscopic Phages and Plasmodium parasites are often in high concentration in sperm and other bodily fluids, larger Pycnogonida may become excited and exit the body via reproductive organs if the host becomes sexually aroused and/or during close intimate contact such as foreplay, etc. Most species of Pycnogonida can leap up to 15 times the length of their leg span. All species of Pycnogonida are capable of sprint-like speed during crawling movements.  

Modern science must quickly realize in today’s virulent age, that diseases as dangerous as HIV and AIDS can transfer from person to person via simply crawling out of an infected person's body cavity, traveling down a pant leg or dropping out of a skirt, finding a healthy person to target and breathing a body cavity such as the mouth, nose, vagina, penis, or anus. A virus can exit a stranger in a restaurant, travel between tables, crawl up your pant leg or dress and enter you without even shaking hands or ever meeting the person. In the 1980s during the height of the AIDS epidemic, NBA players wisely refused to play basketball with HIV victim Magic Johnson to prevent an infection.   

Someone has to know about this... 

Modern medicine and science are suppressed to “prevent widespread panic” via publishing inaccurate claims that close contact such as hugs and kisses cannot transmit HIV while AIDS patients are secretly killed in hospitals when their shedding of the virus becomes too severe. Viruses are highly mobile and aggressive.  

Any healthy body with a Ph level below 9.0 is prey for a species that is drawn to lox-Ph bodies like a magnet via an internal Tritium compass. HIV can survive outside the body for as long as it can find calories and avoid being killed. You can catch a virus infection from someone who sat on a bus seat before you. All phages, cytokines, and plasmodium parasites will take every opportunity to shed from a dying host and infect a new healthy host as a source of fresh calories needed for further reproduction of the species.  

Pycnogonida use radioactive Tritium as a compass 

Pycnogonida Phage Viruses find suitable prey or new hosts by feeling for “charge”, or “Ph level”.  Overabundances and absences of electrons in nearby lifeforms are critical to the parasite when hunting. Negatively charged “Alkaline” bodies and cells with plenty of electrons present a dangerous reducing agent to Pycnogonida and phage viruses. Alkaline bodies are considered a type of chemical predator to the parasite.   

Positively charged “acidic” bodies and cells with a lack of electrons offer no danger of chemical reduction to Pycnogonida and are prey. Pycnogonida target prey and violently leap into any available body cavity. Once a virus population senses the death of a host, the population will exit the dying host in search of a healthy body. Viruses Need a Living Body to survive and are aggressive in Attaining One. 

STDs are symptoms of cavities being used as vesicles for the Pycnogonida Phage Virus 

Pycnogonida often enter a host via the genitalia in both males and females. While female reproductive cavities may present an easier target for varied sizes of Pycnogonida, male genitalia become a direct passage for transfer of smaller Pycnogonida during sexual intercourse. In females, Pycnogonida often create vesicles in the uterus, and in males, Pycnogonida will often create vesicles in the prostate. Infections by the Pycnogonida are often responsible for most reproductive cancers including ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.   

Pycnogonida infections of reproductive organs are responsible for sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, AIDS, HPV, Herpes, Gonorrhea, Crab, Syphilis, etc. Symptoms of Pycnogonida infection of the genitalia in the form of reproductive organ infection and/or cancers include Pycnogonida exiting or shedding from the penis in men or vagina in females. Additionally, Pycnogonida may become excited and exit the body via reproductive organs if the host becomes sexually aroused and/or during close intimate contact such as foreplay, etc. Sores, scabs, and scars found on the exterior epidermal layers of male and female genitalia often result from Pycnogonida bites and/or areas in which a nematocyst has penetrated the epidermis to create a vesicle area. Phages, Plasmodium parasites are often in high concentration within sperm and other bodily fluids associated with sexual intercourse and reproduction. In males and females, “outbreak” or “flare-up” scenarios can occur when a viral load is able to reproduce heavily and exit the body cavities en-mass. In similar scenarios, a sudden rise in an infected host’s Ph level will cause an exodus of Pycnogonida from reproductive organs which from an outside perspective resemble an outbreak or flare-up.   

The Process of Virus Absorption:  

The current theory on virus “absorption" onto healthy cells involves the use of “spike-shaped” protuberances on the viruses called “hemagglutinin” to bind and latch onto sialic acid “receptors" on the targeted cell-like grappling hooks. As the theory continues: as more hemagglutinin binds to more sialic receptors on the cell, the virus adheres to the body of the targeted cell.   

The reality of absorption is: like any other predator in the wild, the Pycnogonida must grip onto areas on its prey where its claws will fit. Once a Pycnogonida gets a hold of a victim with several of its eight legs, the predator will quickly grab a hold of the victim with the rest of its appendages and make aggressive maneuvers to breach its prey.   

On both living bodies and living cells, tactics of predatorial approach by the Pycnogonida species are the same. During microscopic infancy, phage viruses 1/10,000th of a millimeter in diameter are doing the same thing to cells that a 3dm diameter Pycnogonida will do to a fully grown person. Microscopy is never perfect, as scientists are forced to publish explanations for objects, lifeforms, actions, activities, and processes that they cannot see in clear focus. Fancy terminology like hemagglutinin, sialic acid receptors, and binding of the two only supply confusion to the fact that extremely aggressive eight-legged spider-like creatures are jumping onto cells and wrapping their legs around their target to grab hold wherever their claws will fit.  

Pycnogonida in the wild or running loose in human environments are witnessed using eight legs to crawl, run, leap, swim, and climb toward capturing a host suitable for parasitic infection and reproduction. Suitable hosts at any scale include prey with an acidic or low-Ph level, which will not break down and cook off the cell via acid-base REDOX reaction. Hive-minded Pycnogonida are highly intelligent and will use all available senses to look for an available host which will not reduce the virus.  

The Process of Forming a Vesicle:  

The Beginning of Decay in Your Body Cavities  

As soon as Phage viruses have engulfed a cell to complete the process of “absorption”, powerful claws and jaws of the phage viruses begin tearing into the cell and looking for a way inside. Phages tear open cell membranes and/or find existing cavities that attack aggressively. Once an entry point is created or found, more phages begin attacking the opening and digging themselves into pockets called “vesicles”. The vesicle is used as a tophaphagous feeding point for the parasitic phage viruses to drain calories from their new host. Once vesicles are formed in a host cell, the cavity or pocket expands as the host cell is consumed by the invading phage viruses and plasmodium parasites.  

Pycnogonida invade and enter human bodies or other species using methods identical to tactics of cell invasion used by their infant phage viruses at the microscopic level. Pycnogonida target body cavities such as the mouth, nose, ears, eyes, anus, and genitals. Pycnogonida enter the mouth or nose, then use the lungs, throat, sinuses, and the stomach as the parasite’s vesicles to draw blood from within their new host. Areas of a victim’s epidermal layer that is ripped open by the claws and jaws of the Pycnogonida or stung by nematocysts from gonopores on the underside of a Pycnogonida's legs or physalia physalis' tentacles quickly become vesicles for parasite infection. Lesions formed by species of Pycnogonida are recognizable symptoms of certain smallpox, leprosy, herpes, HIV, Equestrian Encephalitis, Malaria, Coronavirus, and multiple influenza infections.  

Physalia Physalis is commonly known as the “Portuguese Man O’ War” and their microscopic scale infant plasmodium parasites create vesicles via epidermal injection of nematocysts into a targeted host. Physalia Physalis and Plasmodium parasites alike wrap their prey up with their exposed tentacles. Once these parasites have a grip on a target body or cell, coils that once led to gonopores in the exoskeleton of their previous form (Pycnogonida) are used to inject nematocysts (infant Pycnogonida) directly into an epidermal layer or cell membrane. These infant Pycnogonida, referred to as “Nematocysts” use a direct coil to epidermal or membrane contact to burrow into a new host much like a blood-sucking tick. Portuguese Man O’ War are deadly to humans and other species if the genus of Pycnogonida which dissolved to form the "jellyfish in appearance" parasite is a type-A or another extremely aggressive variety.  

The Process of Virus Uncoating:  

PPVs rapidly consume calories at an exponential growth rate.  

Once an invading population of Phage viruses has successfully invaded body cavities or the epidermal layer of their targeted prey, the parasite begins consuming their host. The processes of decay which result from parasitic infection by Pycnogonida become the symptoms from which modern medicine creates cases for various diseases. A host becomes not only a source of calories for the parasite but also an incubator for their new spawn. Pycnogonida dissolve the body from within, while Tritium shed from the species becomes a multiplier for the rate of decay within the host. At a microscopic level, the process of a parasite virus dissolving a host cell is called “uncoating”.  

Uncoating begins with a loss of the host’s calories at an exponentially increasing rate. The Pycnogonida is a tophaphagous predator which targets healthy areas within the host’s body from which it can leach available calories from the host. A first-generation invading parasite will consume a host’s calories in excess, grow, and produce as many strong offspring as possible. Second-generation invading parasites produced from the first generations will do the same thing. The population of parasites grows at a rate of 1+40^1+40^2+40^3+40^4 and continues for each generation. Generations can increase within the host by the hour, day, and week depending on the size and genus of the invading species.  

Phages, cytokines, and plasmodium parasites consume a host’s calories at an exponentially increasing rate to exponentially reproduce and spread throughout an infected host. All forms of phages and cytokines are the spawn of Pycnogonida. All forms of plasmodium parasites are forms of Pycnogonida which have been partially reduced by REDOX reaction. All forms of phages and cytokines are toxic. All plasmodium parasites are toxic. All forms of phages, cytokines, and Plasmodium parasite are tophaphagous parasitic predators to proteins, fats, cells, and calories within our bodies.  

PPVs cause deficiency diseases. 

Calorie leaching by Pycnogonida parasites causes conditions of deficiency disease, necrosis, and degeneration. A substantial number of diseases “discovered” by science and medicine of the past and present are simply deficiency diseases defined largely by area of infection and species of Pycnogonida. Diseases of the respiratory system, digestive system, cardiovascular system, nervous system, skeletal system, immune system, muscular system, epidermal system, glandular systems, and systems of the body’s various cavities are believed by current science and medicine to result from separate unknown factors and conditions. Biology in Retrospect, third party microscopy, and virus protein sampling thereof shows that nearly all deficiency diseases of human systems are symptoms of parasite infection by species of Pycnogonida.  

PPVs invade the bloodstream. 

Once a virus infection enters the bloodstream, phage viruses and their plasmodium parasites begin absorbing, forming vesicles, and uncoating a victim’s internal organs. Infection of the bloodstream can lead to diseases such as hemorrhagic diseases like epistaxis. Epistaxis results from the rapid uncoating of veins, arteries, and blood vessels by phage viruses which grow too large within the cardiovascular system to support life within the infected host. When the cardiovascular system uncoats, internal hemorrhaging and external hemorrhaging from the mouth, nose, eyes, skin, Gentelia, anus, and other body cavities results. Blood flooding the brain, termed hyperemia leaves the brain flat and dry. Blood infections of Pycnogonida or Phage virus such as HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis, EEE, etc. Are often transferred between humans via blood-to-blood contact such as mosquito bites, needle sharing, blood transfusions, etc.  

PPVS invade digestive systems. 

Pycnogonida which contaminate food, and water supplies enter a victim’s stomach and spread throughout the digestive system. These parasites cause sharp pain with their eight claws and sharp jaws as they feed on the walls of a host’s stomach and small intestine, microscopic phages of the Pycnogonida can enter the bloodstream and various organs through the digestive system. Signs of a digestive system infection may include Pycnogonida which travel up the esophagus, through the throat, and out of the mouth or those which appear in the stool during bowel movements. Pycnogonida infections in the digestive system stand for a majority of stomach and bowel cancers. 

PPVs invade internal organs 

Viruses attack the cardiovascular system, invade internal organs, destroy tissue, and consume the body’s proteins. Reye’s syndrome and other diseases lead to liver failure. Virus infections cause abscesses and necrosis of the kidneys. Viruses consume protein found within glandular systems such as the adrenal glands, hypothalamus, and lymph glands leading to breakdowns in enzyme and hormone production as well as regulatory functions. Viruses are attracted to bone marrow and will reproduce rapidly once the skeleton is breached, leading to several forms of leukemia. Disease, organ failure, and cancers are the results of infections within the body by Pycnogonida, Physalia Physalis, Phage Viruses, and Plasmodium Parasites.   

PPVs cause radiation sickness and destroy tissue 

All phages, cytokines, and plasmodium parasites emit beta radioactive Tritium into body cavities, vesicles, bloodstream, and respiratory system of an infected host. Beta-decay of tritium from phages, cytokines, and plasmodium parasites causes radiation sickness in an infected host which is often associated as a symptom of a particular disease. Phages, Cytokines, macrophages, Granulocytes, and RNA at their smallest detectible generation hunt and consume calories from the Circulatory system, bloodstream, digestive system, bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, liver, spleen, white matter of the cerebrum, and the meninges surrounding the brain.  

The Process of Respiratory Coronaviruses and COVID Infections:  

Pycnogonida infections of respiratory systems such as the throat and lungs are often diagnosed as diseases such as Coronavirus, COVID, SARS, Tuberculosis, Influenza such as H1N1, Cholera, emphysema, pneumonia, cyanosis, ARDS, and Bubonic Plague. These diseases are resultant of Pycnogonida which have absorbed a targeted host, breached the oral or nasal cavities, created a vesicle in the lungs, and are dissolving or uncoating tissue within the lungs.   

Pycnogonida often attach themselves within the upper respiratory tract, below the larynx. Offspring of the first-generation invader, including microscopic phage viruses, attack epithelial calls within the upper respiratory tract and use them as calories and as incubators for the production of microscopic virus proteins. Often within ten hours of an attack by a phage virus, an epithelial cell will uncoat and burst open to release between 1,000 and 10,000 new virus cells. Epithelial cells make up the insulation or lining of the entire respiratory tract. As a virus infection consumes a host’s epithelial cells, the throat becomes stripped and raw. A sore throat is often the first sign of a viral infection. Victims often begin feeling symptoms during the fifth or sixth generation of the virus’ reproduction.  

If the host’s immune system cannot break down and kill a virus infection during its incubation within the upper respiratory system, proteins will continue to breed ad spread downward into the lungs themselves. “Acute inflammatory injection (AII)” is the process of rapid necrosis of the epithelial lining of the bronchial tree. Pycnogonida and their microscopic phage offspring begin ripping apart capillaries and bronchioles within the lungs. Lungs become clogged with growing virus proteins, blood, fluids, and scar tissues. Essential “surfactant” within the lungs disappears and the function of oxygen absorption within the lungs rapidly decreases. Extreme distress on the lungs termed “acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)” is a process that is accepted as unstoppable by modern medicine and science. Modern intensive care units administer oxygen to ARDS patients in an effort to keep victims alive until they can recover. Coronaviruses such as the 2003 outbreak of “severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)” and the 2019 outbreak of COVID-19 kill humans via ARDS. In ARDS, victims' organs fail due to lack of oxygen, fluids in the lungs leach into the heart causing strain on the heart, or breathing just stops.  

Viral infection of the respiratory tract may also lead to bacterial pneumonia. A lack of epithelial cells destroys a victim’s ability to clear the respiratory tract of bacteria. Pycnogonida, virus proteins, and lethal bacteria flow freely into the lungs. ARDS becomes pneumonia when the lungs “consolidate” or become hard, solid, stiff, and inelastic. Pneumonia is often a result of an infection of a bacteria called pneumococci. Pneumonia often kills by either restricting the flow of oxygen into the victim, or by the creation of fissures, cracks, and sores in stiff lung tissue which allows virus proteins and bacteria into the victim’s bloodstream.  

End-of-Life Degeneration 

Viruses invade internal organs, destroy tissue, and consume the body’s proteins. Reye’s syndrome and other diseases lead to liver failure. Virus infections cause abscesses and necrosis of the kidneys. Viruses consume protein found within glandular systems such as the adrenal glands, hypothalamus, and lymph glands leading to breakdowns in enzyme and hormone production as well as regulatory functions. Viruses are attracted to bone marrow and will reproduce rapidly once the skeleton is breached, leading to several forms of leukemia. Disease, organ failure, and cancers are a result of infections within the body by Pycnogonida, Physalia Physalis, Phage Viruses, and Plasmodium Parasites.   

Tetanus, Meningitis, Necrosis, and degeneration of the muscular systems can result from the uncoating of a victim’s muscular proteins. Cyanosis develops in the epidermal layer as the death of portions of the body result from a lack of oxygen flow in the blood and the body turns black with the appearance of frostbite. Emphysema and Smallpox boils appear at the surface of the victim’s skin as air channels form in the body from open lesions and cracks in the lungs. These air channels allow air to escape the lungs and form pockets under the skin where viruses produce new vesicles. Phage viruses may travel through these oxygen fissures and burst from Smallpox sores when the victim is near death. When these pockets burst, the skin rips open, further exposing the body to external infection while simultaneously shedding virus proteins from within. Headaches of the ear, sinus, and eyes result from inflammation of the inner ear and sinus cavities as the body tries to purge oversized virus proteins through mucus channels which become a clogged bottleneck. These sinus and mucus channels bloat with intense pressure and can lead to otitis media and subconjunctival hemorrhaging.  

Phages, Plasmodium Parasites, and The Immune System:  

Phages Are NOT a Part of Our Natural Immune System  

Pycnogonida offspring, termed “macrophages” by past and present scientists have been previously believed to be a product of immune system response by an infected host. Macrophages have been inaccurately theorized to exist as part of the immune system because they attack and consume all types of bacteria as prey. Additionally, a higher presence of white blood cells and antibacterial enzymes near microphage infections within the body have misled man scientists to believe that Macrophages produce or stimulate the growth of the white blood cells and enzymes. Biology in Retrospect recognizes that these macrophages kill both invading bacteria and healthy cells within the body because they are predatorial and will consume any available calories. In reality, white blood cells and antibacterial enzymes found near macrophage colonies are a product of the immune system’s attempt to fight off macrophages and are not a product of the macrophages themselves.  

An error of proximity has led to mistakes in microscopy. Scientists often mistake the proximity of the two substances under a microscope as evidence that one produces the other. In fact, the proximity of the two substances under a microscope is often a result of the arrival of one substance to combat the other.  

Third-Party Microscopy and the process of reviewing video surveillance and other data on large breed Pycnogonida in retrospect shows that the species produces only three things:  

The first being more phages from reproduction  

The second being Physalia Physalis from REDOX reduction of the exoskeleton in the species and its offspring  

The third being Tritium-rich waste which causes radiation poisoning in the infected victim  

The Pycnogonida is not a chemist, a cook, or a magician. The Species simply does not have the means, ability, or intention to produce anything but more offspring. These are facts of reality that science must accept if our species and others are to survive.  

The misconception of varied generations of phages, identified by varied size under a microscope as separate species of cytokines such as macrophages, granulocytes, and RNA proteins has led to inaccurate belief systems within scientific and medicinal fields. Research and published literature suffer from theories and beliefs that have been inaccurately formulated after standing above antiquated microscopes by scientists and dealing with political compartmentalization of large breed Pycnogonida in Nuclear Reactors or environments where the species are found.  

An example of an inaccurate belief system published by modern science is that cytokines that bind to receptors in the hypothalamus and raise body temperature are part of a victim’s natural immune system and a response to a viral infection. In reality, observations of Pycnogonida show that the species can survive at well over 105 degrees Fahrenheit and much higher temperatures than anything found within a living human body. Cytokines bind to the hypothalamus for no other reason than because it is a source of readily available calories for consumption by the predator species.  

Another example of an inaccurate belief system published by modern science is that cytokines that reproduce in the bone marrow of an infected host stimulate the production of white blood cells by an infected host. Many scientists believe white blood cell production by cytokines within the bone marrow of an infected host is the source of the aching bone pain and inflammation associated with a virus infection. In reality, cytokines, macrophages, and granulocytes reproduce in bone marrow because it is a source of expansive, densely packed valuable calories that support the rapid growth and reproduction of the species. Higher levels of white blood cells are formed near and around populations of cytokines in bone marrow because the body is trying to kill these phage virus populations. Aching bones, pain, and inflammation of the skeletal system is a symptom of spider-like crab creatures crawling around within our bones and consuming the marrow, which is contained within our skeleton, not from stimulation of white blood cells.  

Yet another example of an inaccurate belief system published by modern science and medicine involves the “cytokine storm” which is defined as a dilation of the body's capillaries and a flood of fluid throughout the body which contains white blood cells, antibacterial enzymes, antibodies, and high volumes of cytokines. These fluids fill the lungs, inflame the body, pour from the throat, nasal cavities, and sweat glands. In reality, the flood of white blood cells, antibacterial enzymes, and antibodies is an immune system response which attacks, kills, and floods out cytokines, macrophages, and granulocytes from every available cavity and pore of the body. Cytokines are a hostile and foreign enemy being driven out of the body by this flood, not a part of the immune system itself. These floods can severely damage the lungs and cause death. Consuming nutrient-vitamin-rich alkaline fluids and shedding dead cytokines via phlegm, snot, and sweat with vigorous exercise has been proven to promote faster recovery during these immune system flooding responses. Running and cardio help clear blockages of the bronchi and aids the body in breaking down and removing toxins. Coughing out and spitting mucus during isolated intense cardio exercise is the fastest way to remove toxins from an infected person during military trials. Use of heat via a hot shower and the use of a sauna promotes open pores within the skin which removes clogs in pores within the epidermal layer and allows shedding of waste fluids.  

Yet another example of an inaccurate belief system published by modern science and medicine is the existence of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) as a part of an infection victim’s immune system response. TNF is named after its ability to melt tumors in laboratory tests. In reality, TNF proteins are very microscopic generations of macrophages that consume tumors as a source of calories. TNF is lethal, the antigen destroys any cells which it encounters. TNF is a predator which kills the entire body. TNF is a major cause of toxic shock syndrome.  

The Process of Demyelination and Acquired Diseases:  

Viral Infection effects on the Nervous System  

Pycnogonida and their associated viral infections attack, destroy and manipulate the brain, spine, and nervous system of victims which they infect. During autopsies of victims of lethal viruses, the proteins, cytokines, macrophages, granulocytes, plasmodium parasites, and their various Genuses are found within the white matter of the cerebrum, in the meninges which surrounds the brain, and within the spinal cord.  

In the brain, virus infections target and consume the fatty lipid content which surrounds and insulates neurons, dendrites, and nerve bundles contained within the white matter of the cerebrum. The fatty lipid layers which cover and insulate these portions of the brain are called Myelin. Myelin to the function of the nervous system is similar to the silicone insulation found on circuit boards which separates individual electric components, or that which surrounds and insulates electrical copper wires and cables. Myelin protects and isolates electrical signals produced within the brain which travel down the spinal cord and throughout the nervous system. To viruses, Mylin has only one function, being a source of available calories as a food supply. When Myelin which protects the brain is consumed in a process called Demyelination, electrical signals within the nervous system are unprotected.  

Degeneration of signal power and quality of transmissions throughout the nervous system are common systems of Demyelination resembles symptoms of decay found on insulation within electrical systems and devices from rodent infestations. Acute demyelination of the nervous system can lead to more severe short circuits within the nervous system of a victim of a virus infection. Acute demyelination or short-circuiting of the nervous system is often responsible for seizures, tremors, shaking, spasms, uncontrollable muscle movement, physical impairment, mental degradation, and trouble during speech found as epidemic diseases such as M.S., Parkinson’s, and epilepsy.  

Demyelination can only be halted and reversed via removal of the virus infection from the body and consumption of massive volumes of regenerative supplements such as collagen, MSM, and glucosamine, and amino acids. Zinc is used by the body to build and repair neurons and nerves within your body. These regenerative supplements help rebuild the Myelin lipid content throughout the nervous system. While modern science and medicine offer multiple prescriptions and medications to treat Demyelination in victims of disease, only high-Ph alkaline treatments and high intake of regenerative supplement-rich diets can repair and stimulate Myelin growth needed for rebuilding and supporting a healthy nervous system.  

Pycnogonida are a highly intelligent, hive-minded species that uses electrical signals generated from Tritium beta decay as a method of communication. Coiled nervous systems found within the species use double latch gates to keep quantum bonds between generations of the species. Physical breakage between a child Pycnogonida’s nervous system and the gonopore of its parent leaves behind chemical bonds which can transmit electrical signals throughout offspring exponentially produced by generations of the species. Electrical signals, data, information, communication, and knowledge received by a signal Pycnogonida is available to a neural network which is expanded throughout every connected generation of the species. The neural network available to Pycnogonida is larger than any other species found on earth, except possibly for another yet Unkown species of polyping medusa found within the ocean.  

Exponentially reproducing Pycnogonida parasites that have gained access to an infected host’s brain and neural network quickly learn (or already have knowledge) of the language of signal code used by the human nervous system to command the executive functions. In “Acquired” diseases, a host or victim has been demyelinated and the viral infection has acquired the ability to intercept, interpret, and send electrical signals to and from an infected brain of an infected host. A victim of an acquired disease becomes a puppet of varying degrees of control to a type of “middle-man attack" by the virus population. Acquired victims stand for the well-documented appearance of schizophrenia, delirium, mental inertia, physical prostration, psychosis, mental collapse, mental disturbances, and general insanity documented after the appearance of a majority of historical influenza and virus outbreaks.  

At the height of the largest and deadliest virus epidemic in modern recorded history, the influenza outbreak of 1918 brought in reports of outbreak induced mental disturbances from all over the world:  

At the U.S. Army’s Walter Reed Hospital, physicians Dr. Egbert Fell reported via the June 1919 issue of the Journal of the American Medicine Association, that patients possessed “Delirium occurring at the height of the Disease”, and that these symptoms did not “clear with cessation of fever”. Patients developed severe mental health symptoms during influenza infections which did not pass even when other symptoms of the virus had. Doctors in Britain reported “profound mental inertia with intense physical prostration. Delirium has been very common … It has varied from more confusion of ideas through all grades on intensity up to maniacal excitement”. Influenza patients were having and communicating wild ideas that may not have existed prior to a virus infection. These victims became motivated by these ideas from an unknown origin to the point that they became excited and overcame physical inhibitions in response. These symptoms resulted from the presence of alien virus infections.   

Dr. G Draggeti of Italy reported to “Politico” in a February 8, 1919, article titled "Nervous Manifestations of Influenza” reported that “The [influenza] psychosis however may pass into a state of mental collapse, with stupor which may persist and become actual dementia”. Those who had become infected with the 1918 H1N1 virus variant in many cases mentally broke down into a daze and lost control of previously held mental abilities.   

Dr. Henri Claude of France reported in a May 31, 1919, issue of JAMA, in an article titled "Nervous and Mental Disturbances Following Influenza” that patients suffered from “Frequent and serious mental disturbances during convalescence from and as a result of Influenza … The mental disturbances sometimes took on the form of acute delirium with agitation, violence, fear, and erotic excitation and … fear of persecution”. Patients in recovery from the 1918 virus infection became violently delirious, agitated, paranoid, and severely aggressive. While sexual aggression may have been a manifestation of the viruses will to spread. The host feared repercussions of activities associated with their previously held moral control, yet they could often not control these new immoral urges.  

These reports detail an event in 1918 in which millions of people worldwide simultaneously experienced thoughts, motivations, and excitement that had not existed before virus infection. Our population began exhibiting thoughts and intentions that were not our own and of an alien source and nature.   

These new symptoms were found via observation of the human nervous system, a symptom of electrical signals, during infection by foreign parasites. These parasites were mobilized via nervous networks powered by tritium produced by the virus digestive systems, according to basic sciences of chemistry and physics, the laws related to conservation of energy clearly state that energy cannot be created or destroyed, and that energy can only be transferred from one location to another via entropy. According to laws of conservation of energy, symptoms of mental inertia, motivation, and physical prostration experienced during the 1918 influenza infection could not have originated or been created within a victim's nervous system without transfer of energy in the form of entropy from electrical signals from another source (being the 1918 foreign H1N1 phage virus).  

Exothermic signaling via controlled beta decay of the tritium within the virus parasite’s cells are the most likely source of endothermic signals received by the nervous system of a human host. Viruses that have eaten away the Myelin lining of the white matter in the cerebrum expose the raw zinc wiring of the brain and nervous system. Demyelinated neurons in the brain become an exposed communication network that is highly vulnerable to third-party “man in the middle” attacks by foreign parasites.  

Highly intelligent phage viruses are part of a quantum hive-minded neural network which is composed of the Genus of the Pycnogonida species from which a specific virus infection variant is derived. Phage virus parasites use their ovigars to tap into the neural networks of their demyelinated hosts, A demyelinated network of a host’s neural network begins leaching signals into the quantum hive mind network of the invading Pycnogonida species or variant thereof.   

Phages of multiple generations of viral species have worked together over several millennia to learn and interpret the language of coded signals used by the human brain. Viruses that have demyelinated a new host quickly begin the process of exploiting the victim’s neural network which manages body functions such as breathing, heart rate, and spatial awareness. The executive functions network which is largely similar throughout a species controls the actus rheus of an individual or the intended muscle movement of a host.   

In addition to these more common neural networks, every individual brain possesses an incredibly unique network called “experience expectant” wiring. Experience expectant neurons are built during the individualized learning experience which every person endures as a child, and throughout adulthood. Every individual learns different things from different perspectives, at different times. Neurons that relate to similar cause and effect relationships learned by many individuals are located in very different locations in every human brain. In addition to experience independent and experience expectant wiring, neurosurgeon George Ojemann has discovered that in the brain maps of 117 brain surgeries, 79 percent of patients had common areas for language.  

Experience Independent, experience expectant executive function and speech-related wiring within the brain are all valuable to Demyelination and acquisition by a viral parasite infection. Basic forms of psychosis such as physical prostration, and dementia-related speech which results from parasite infections are most likely the first sign of virus acquisition because the neural networks which control physical movement and communication are largely similar throughout the human species. More advanced symptoms of psychosis such as paranoia, violence, fear, and erotic excitation are most likely signs of late-term and advanced infections. Neural networks which control specific functions such as sexual intercourse, violent attacks, and knowledge of actions and their consequences are individually learned by each host and must be acquired by a virus parasite via surveillance of the infected host.  

Intelligence has been observed in the Pycnogonida species by their ability to learn movement habits of prey which they are stalking. Pycnogonida have been observed setting traps at common entry points in an effort to trap and attack passing humans. The signaling ability has been seen by large breed Pycnogonida in the form of directed light pulses emitted from the ovigars of some Pycnogonida species, and the tails of other Pycnogonida species such as the HIV genus (black colored with large overhanging tail and red tips at the claw and tail).   

These directed light signals are directed at the eyes of the prey of a hunting Pycnogonida and cause epileptic seizure responses or a paralysis like the famed medusa of Greek mythology from which polyping species of aquatic life get their name. Strangely, the twisted tentacles of the Physalia physalis are similar in appearance to a head of snake hair which is described as a Medusa’s identifying feature in Greek texts.  

A population of exponentially multiplying phages which have taken a parasitic infection of a new host, HIV for example quickly spread throughout the brain and begin the process of simultaneously stripping the insulation from the wires of our brain. This exponentially multiplying population begins the process of acquiring their host. The exponentially multiplying population begins the process of group learning by wiretapping the signaling process of their host. The exponentially multiplying population acts as an expanding think-tank to quickly decode the host’s signaling processes used to initiate executive functions and motor controls of the host. When an exponentially multiplying population begins piloting the host’s speech and motor control, the disease has become an Acquired infection. In this method, HIV easily becomes AIDS via demyelination, signal decoding, and nervous system hijacking.  

Hijacking of a host’s motor functions begins with simple test routines. During the influenza outbreak of 1918, the U.S. Army reported “Symptoms referable to the central nervous system were seen at times, as twitching of the muscles of the fingers, forearms, and face, … and active, even maniacal occasional delirium, or usually the low mumbling type.” As simple control of a host becomes exponentially increasing control and the disease is acquired, a host of a parasite population becomes a Zooid Mobilized Biological Entity (ZMBE).  

A Zooid Mobilized Biological Entity (ZMBE) is any host of a virus infection that has lost a medium to a high level of physical control to the parasite population. A ZMBE is used by the parasite population to breed, incubate, and spread a virus to new hosts within a targeted population belonging to the host’s species. Parasite control over a population in infected hosts is likely the source of instances where AIDs patients knowingly, willfully, and purposefully infect others with the virus. The virus population kills the host which it consumes. The parasite’s primary method for survival is to spread to as many healthy hosts as possible.  

The alien Pycnogonida species including all Genuses thereof are exploiting the human population of Earth for use as living incubators or their species to grow to a large breed and populate our planet. Large breed Pycnogonida which have been incubated during a parasite infection migrate primarily via municipal waste systems to Earth’s, coastlines, and oceans. These large breed Pycnogonida are right now exponentially reproducing and over-populating Earth’s oceans. Large breed viruses often come to land and invade coastal cities in an H.G. Wells “War of the Worlds” type scenario.  

Organized Biological Genocide:  

Industrial, Medical, and Military Use  

Nearly a century after the great influenza outbreak of 1918, the United States Military has industrialized the use of large breed phage viruses or Pycnogonida, allowing engineers and scientists to witness the reproductive or spawning habits of the species from a new perspective. Tritium is harvested from Pycnogonida which are 20 meters in diameter on many nuclear aircraft carriers, which have produced opportunities for engineers and scientists to witness the birth of new “encapsulated large breed viruses from both Pycnogonida with polysaccharide exoskeletons, and Physalia physalis who’s outer protective layer has been dissolved. Future theory must accept that transformation of viruses without capsules into viruses with capsules is not possible. Physalia physalis instead give birth to new encapsulated Pycnogonida in the form of Nematocysts. 

As some humans live with the belief that we can exploit the Pycnogonida for Tritium to supply electricity to our populations, in reality, our commercial and military-industrial breeding of the species is the single most activity responsible for the spread and invasion of our species by the alien Pycnogonida throughout our planet. Companies like Pirbright, Enron, Weyerhaeuser, etc. Breed Pycnogonida to the largest size possible to harvest the most Tritium possible. Tritium is a radioactive unstable liquid containing H3 which is used to create electrical currents via beta decay of electrical currents. After discovering the Pycnogonida violently exploded when exposed to electrical shock, tritium was then spun within tubes of centrifuges to extract solids nicknamed “tube alloy” which is used to create atomic weapons and power electrical grids.  

Breeding Giant Pycnogonida has giant consequences. When a Pycnogonida being harvested for tritium grows too large for containment, it is often let loose into the ocean and replaced by one of its younger smaller offspring. When these Pycnogonida are released from river or oceanside nuclear plants, nuclear warships, or submarines, they grow by feeding on oceanic life, reproduce in our oceans, and eventually come back to a land where we live.  

Pycnogonida grow to sizes with limits unknown to science. As a limit to how small a phage virus can be spawned is not known, a limit to how large a Pycnogonida can grow has never been discovered.  

In China, a Pycnogonida which towered over the city appeared out of the Ocean. The event which was captured on the video featured the giant dark red Pycnogonida and the fog which emitted from the heat of its body evaporating the seawater from its exoskeleton. As the large Pycnogonida released its polyps over Wuhan China, the resulting virus swarm targeted “Wet markets” as an easy source of calories. This event is likely the source of the Wuhan Coronavirus of 2019 which was a forerunner to the international COVID-19 epidemic.  

If a 13km diameter Pycnogonida the size of the Wuhan invader crawls out of the ocean and reaches a densely populated city. It can release up to 40 offspring of a descendant generation with diameters up to 1km. Following exponential reproduction, each of these 1 km, 2nd generation offspring may produce 40 offspring each. Each generation produces exponentially increasing numbers following the equation: 40^1 + 40^2 + 40^3 … with each exponent being the next generation.  

Following this logic, a 13km Pycnogonida releases hundreds of millions of extremely aggressive, hive-minded Pycnogonida which are small enough to crawl down your throat. These small generations of Pycnogonida release Billions and Trillions of Phage viruses which cover cities and start regional, national, and international outbreaks. These are currently occurring facts behind accidental outbreaks associated with industrial Pycnogonida forming.  

With more outbreaks come more demyelinated victims. With more demyelinated parasite hosts comes more ZMBEs. Each Zooid Mobilized Biological Entity is a possible source of biological attacks. In many situations, owners, staff, and employees of industrial Pycnogonida become biologically infected by samples, cultures, specimens, and persons, infected with phages and plasmodium parasites.  

Henrietta Lacks (HeLa) Cells:  

Phages in HeLa contaminate hospitals and previously healthy environments  

Samples of Henrietta Lacks’ cervical Tumer taken during a 1951 biopsy at John Hopkins have been used as the primary source of Human cultures used in medical research for over 70 years. These cells, termed HeLa are coveted for their ability to grow indefinitely in culture mediums are widely used for mass distribution to doctors, scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and universities. HeLa cells have been used to cure polio, and test the human response to lethal diseases, new medicines, treatments, radiation, and conditions such as zero gravity in space flight and high gravity environments.  

Henrietta Lacks died in 1951 with Human Papilloma Virus or HPV-18, either from the disease or from early forms of chemotherapy involving radium (tube alloy) being sewn into her vagina or the use of high-level X-Ray which cooked the flesh of her abdomen until her lower body was charred black. Samples of HeLa cells have been reproduced for three-quarters of a century, all of which contain the HPV-18 virus. This phage virus is a known contaminator of laboratories all over the world via infection by the HPV-18 phage virus variant, a fact first discovered by cell culturist Lewis Coriell.   

In all contamination cases by HeLa specimens, one fact is clear: Cancer spreads to nearby cultures in laboratories without any clear physical contact. Identification of the HPV phage virus as a Genus of Pycnogonida helps explain how cancer spreads from the ZMBE HeLa culture to any biological specimen nearby. As HeLa is warned from a supercooled state used for storage and transport, phage viruses grow within the human culture. HeLa is quickly consumed by the virus, and microscopic phage viruses quickly grow into small Pycnogonida which can crawl, leap, and run out of ZMBE HeLa specimens and into nearby cultures which are new sources of calories. Millions of dollars in worldwide damage associated with HeLa contamination could be limited or reduced by breeding and shipping HeLa which contains colloidal silver, zinc, creatine, niacin, and other high Ph alkaline decontamination agents.  

  

Elimination of Viral Species:  

Stopping Virus Spread by Ending its Production  

Until Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis are widely recognized and accepted by modern science as the parents to phage viruses and Plasmodium parasites, humans and every other species on earth will continue to fall victim to parasitic infection by these aquatic species.   

Current theory accepts that viruses often spread to other species from wild aquatic birds. Birds are a highly mobile spreading mechanism for these species as they eat infected sea life or virus proteins (Pycnogonida) themselves before dropping feces in populated areas. Aquatic avian spread of infectious disease will likely remain the method of infection which scientists, engineers, and medical professionals are least able to stop as aquatic birds will likely always exist and the ocean is the natural home to the Pycnogonida and its alternative form; the Physalia Physalis.   

Methods and technologies for fighting off body cavity and epidermal breaching by viruses are steadily changing, evolving, and getting better. Physical barriers used to protect ourselves from growing populations of Pycnogonida will not last forever. Scientists, doctors, engineers, and healthcare workers are taking a step forward with various materials used to protect human body cavities and skin from becoming vesicles for virus populations to live and breed. For every step forward made by humans in creating physical barriers against parasitic virus infections, our species takes three steps backward via the use of Pycnogonida for commercial, industrial, and biological warfare applications.  

If we cannot stop the most ancient and robust form of viral spread, we can do our best to protect ourselves from Pycnogonida, Physalia Physalis, Phages, and Plasmodium Parasites which are currently over breeding in the ocean and spreading throughout our population. In 2020, protecting our body cavities with masks that cover the mouth and nose has become legally mandated widely throughout our planet in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic.   

Protecting our genitalia and anal cavities from infection by use of condoms, STD tests, and certain selective breeding methods have been used for millennia as shown by ancient akin condoms and became more popular in recent times during the rise of HIV and AIDS.   

Quarantine during ancient leprosy outbreaks has only become more advanced during modern outbreaks of lethal virus infectious diseases like Malaria, COVID, and Ebola.  

Humans must protect our eyes, ears, mouth, and nose from becoming vesicles for virus infection by using them to see, listen, and discuss scientific research on the dangers of the Pycnogonida species, their variants, and their stripped-down, partially reduced form as Physalia Physalis. Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis have no place in any laboratory, reactor, factory, marine vessel, or field. When found in the wild the viruses should be killed immediately. Instead of breeding the proteins in laboratories to figure out new methods of killing them, they should be hunted in the wild and killed by drones that employ experimental strategies. The new rule of combating viruses is “less is more”. The survival of all life which exists, including our species, depends on a strictly mandated and legally enforceable adherence to this rule. We may have to kill those who cannot.
