<p>The female Physalia Physalis plasmodial parasite (Portuguese man o war) carries reproductive organs in her tentacles called cnidocytes. Female cnidocytes are used to mate with the gonopores of the male physalia physalis phage/virus/antigen (Pycnogonida). Antigens are born as the nematocysts of the physalia physalis which grow 2 or 3 feet in diameter. A major conspiracy and coverup behind AIDS is that many patients die when they are killed by hospitals to prevent infection, as pycnogonida literally leap out of the victim's bodily openings.</p>

<p>A widespread viral outbreak in the 80's was discovered and called HIV and AIDS, today scientists who do not understand the multiple stages of pycnogonida (antigens), mulching, and physalia physalis (plasmodium parasites) label the virus differently when discovered in new regions. In Africa terms like Malaria and Small Pox are used, a current epidemic in China is being called Coronavirus, and Many cases in America are now being called Eastern Equestrian Encephalitis or multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Upon fertilization by mating, Male and female counterparts are formed together as Nematocysts within Cnidocytes in the female's tentacles. During larval stages, while still within the mother's Nematocysts, the larvae is weaponized and used to attack and parasitically infect prey. When the Nematocysts outgrow the Cnidocytes of the mother, they are released into the ocean to begin a new lifecycle.</p>

# Antigen viruses cause demyelination

Viruses that cause demyelination deteriorate the protective layers of the nervous system to gain semi-control of the host. Most coronavirus deaths are associated with an infected host being killed for displaying erratic behavior which prohibits contained treatment and causes a danger to others. Antigen parasites literally take over your body and build chemical connections to neural pathways using appendages called ovigers. Some diseases really come down to mental.

# Natural Female Biology (plasmodium parasites)

Inspect the video thumbnail below before you press play. Within the clear tentacles of the physalia physalis are highly visible nematocysts (pycnogonida).

The female Physalia with her shell resembles a common Pycnogonid Sea Spider. Males rip the shell and eyes off of females (often in utero) to inhibit movement, fully expose her gonopores, and to enforce dominance. The result of a female Physalia Physalis's shell being removed is the Portuguese man o war "Jellyfish" creature. The female's blatter expands without a protective covering and the creature is forced to the top of the ocean.

Without an exoskeleton to anchor her muscles to, the female Physalia is unable to move freely. The exposed Physalia lacks any protection and must use her gonopores and train her young as her only defense. Her gonomores which once transferred her eggs into the mail are now used to inject them into any creature she comes across. Gonopores are used as Cnidocytes and male Physalia Physalis Nematocysts are ejected into new hosts. Host cells die and the virus moves onto a healthy target.

# Natural Male Biology (Virus Protein Antigens)

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/CORONAVIRUS.png)

An extinction-level event arrises in the fact that as larvae Nematocysts, the Physalia Physalis is grown as a weapon used to inject itself into a target prey. Fully Grown Physalia Physalis resemble large, tailed sea spiders and are known to seek out and parasitically infect mammals on land including humans. Through the evolution of weaponized infancy, the fully grown male Physalia Physalis is able to navigate, track and gain entry into a human host as part of it's a natural cycle. Openings such as mouth, throat, anal cavity and Vagina are used to gain entry into a targeted host.

# Tritium Production in Lithium Based Life Forms

Physalia Physalis is a lithium based life form which digests it's prey using an organic form of tritium found withing it's digestive system. Physalis physalis uses sunlight produce tritium from lithium. Pycnogonida will seek out light to produce this digestive chemical and if a lack of light exists the species will remain tophagous. The species is naturally radioactive and destroys soft tissue in the body in a process called Demyelination. RNA sized phage viruses re-arrange DNA and replicate dead tissue using genetically modified proteins.

High concentrations of tritium found within the physalia physalis create biological weaknesses within the species. Physalia physalis are repelled from positively charged metals and many substances. Positively charged metals act as a hyper-cathode to plasmodium parasites, and antigens becoming radioactive to their lattice structure.

# The Truth About Nuclear Energy

![Physalia Physalis demyelination](https://d1vqblqxu9wcq3.cloudfront.net/images/Nuclear-Reactor.jpg)

Nuclear reactors currently in operation are various designs for farming pycnogonida and harvesting Tritium. Tritium is collected in pools which are connected to copper cables which run to power companies. Pools are often makeshift or commercially available materials filled with Tritium, with a copper cable that simply runs the length of tunnel to nearby power station.
